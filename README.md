# TweetCloud
Very simple set of scripts to use twython and wordcloud2.js to produce a word clouds from twitter's streaming api

The raw data that was collected is contained in the data folder along with the sqlite database with both tables, including 'boringwords' - words such as 'the', 'it', 'and' etc that were filtered out from the visualisation - but still counted.

This probably isn't enough info for any real scientific or statistic evaluation but feel free to email me with any questions (email through my website http://www.a-barber.com )
